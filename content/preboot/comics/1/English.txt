ROBYN: Ha! Found you!

|||||: Robyn? What are you doing here?
ROBYN: Looking for you. What are *you* doing out here anyway?

|||||: Oh, just thinking. 

ROBYN: Thinkin' about *what*???
|||||: nothing, really...

ROBYN: Is it because I walked in on you wearing girly clothes? I thought you looked kinda cute honestly.

|||||: N-No! ...I mean- Well...

|||||: I should probably tell you... You can keep a secret, right?
ROBYN: (nodding) 

(||||| sighs)

|||||: Something feels off about being, you know, a boy. I'd rather, um, be a girl, or something.

|||||: I can't believe I just admitted that...

ROBYN: You know, I always wanted a big sister! 

ROBYN: Either way, I don't see any reason to think less of you.

|||||: Thanks, Robyn.

ROBYN: Ooh! Does this mean you'll play dress-up with me now?
|||||: uhh maybe later
